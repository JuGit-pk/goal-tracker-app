# Learning Node/Express API Project

## Overview

This repo is dedicated to my learning journey in creating APIs using Node.js and structuring Express projects. Here, I focus on mastering the essentials of Node.js and Express, specifically delving into the intricacies of API development and project structuring.

## Purpose

## Project Structure

- **`src/controllers`:** Handlers for incoming requests and managing business logic.
- **`src/middlewares`:** Custom middlewares enhancing Express application functionality.
- **`src/routes`:** Definitions for API routes and associated handlers.
- **`src/utils`:** Utility functions and modules for project-wide use.

## What I've Learned

1. **API Development:** Designing RESTful APIs and managing routes using Express.
2. **Project Structure:** Organizing code for readability, maintainability, and scalability.
3. **Middlewares:** Implementing custom middlewares for tasks like authentication and error handling.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone:** clone this project
2. **Navigate:** `cd goal-tracking-app`
3. **Install:** `npm install`
4. **Run:** `npm run server`
